# Stellar_structure
This repository containts a Jupyter notebook that walks through the calculation of stellar structure for a 1.5 solar mass ZAMS star. The text file contains the output of the stellar structure code, where the columns in order are: Lagrangian mass coordinate, temperature, radius, luminosity, and pressure. 
The solar opacities text file provides the opacity table that was interpolated to find the opacity at different locations throughout the star.
